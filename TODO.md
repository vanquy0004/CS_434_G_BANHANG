# Firebase Image Upload Implementation

## Tasks
- [ ] Update FE/frontend/src/firebase.js with real Firebase config (user needs to provide API key, project ID, etc.)
- [x] Add uploadImage function to FE/frontend/src/services/productService.js using Firebase storage
- [x] Add image upload UI to FE/frontend/src/pages/ProductsPage.vue
- [x] Update fetchProducts in productService.js to use Firebase image URLs when available
- [x] Test image upload functionality (UI works, upload fails due to placeholder config)
